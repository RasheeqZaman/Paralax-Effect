		<p>Sajek is a union under Baghaichari Upazila in Rangamati district. Basically it is name of a river which separates Bangladesh from India. Sajek Valley is situated in the North angle of Rangamati, near to the Mizoram border area. The valley is about 1,800 ft. high from the sea level. The place is locally known as hill queen for its natural beauty and roof among the people. And Sajek is one of the big union in Rangamati district which is called to be remote area from the Rangamati town.

		<p>Though Sajek is situated under Baghaichari Upazeila in Rangamati but I would suggest you to go through Khagrachari. From Dhaka, you can go to Khagrachari by Shyamoli and Hanif Paribahan, bus fare is 520 Taka. If you want to go to Dighinala directly by Shanti Paribahan then bus fare is 580 Taka. BRTC and Saint Martin Paribahan's AC buses are also available. After reaching to Khagrachari you need to hire a Chander Gari to go to Sajek. It is about 106 km from Khgarachari.
		</p>
		<p>There is an extraordinary fountain named Toiduchara in Dighinala, but if you want to see it, you will have to spend one day separately for this fountain only. It will take about 6-7 hours to walk from Jamtoli of Dighinala to go to the fountain. From Dighinala bus station to by easy bike, you can go to Jamaltali, and rent is 10 taka per person. With the course of going to this fountain, you will definitely get enough dry food, because after Jamtali there are no more shops. If you want to stay in Dighinala, you can stay at the Dighinala Guest House, it is located on the opposite side of the bus stand. The condition of the guest house is good enough. You can take room between 300 and 500 Taka.
